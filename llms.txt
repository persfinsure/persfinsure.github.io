## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is visitor insurance for parents visiting the USA?**
Visitor insurance is a temporary health and travel insurance policy designed for non-US residents visiting the United States. It covers medical emergencies, hospitalization, and other healthcare costs during the visit.

**Does Persfinsure cover pre-existing conditions?**
Yes, Persfinsure offers plans with acute onset coverage for pre-existing conditions, meaning sudden and unexpected flare-ups of pre-existing conditions may be covered up to policy limits.

**What is cashless hospitalization?**
Cashless hospitalization means the insurance company settles the hospital bill directly with the network hospital, so the insured person does not need to pay upfront and file for reimbursement.

**How much does visitor insurance cost?**
The cost varies based on age, trip duration, coverage amount, deductible chosen, and whether pre-existing condition coverage is included. You can get an instant quote on our website.

**Who needs visitor insurance in the USA?**
Anyone visiting the USA who is not covered under a US health insurance plan — especially parents visiting from India, international students, new immigrants, exchange visitors, and tourists.
